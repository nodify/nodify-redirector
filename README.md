nodify-redirector
=================

Connect.js middleware to perform URL redirection.

Sorry to say, but I don't have time to document this package right now.

But, if you're brave, cd into the example directory, run make, convert all
instances of "example.com" to your redirector host name, add your favorite
database hostname, user, password in properties.json and run the example
redirector with the command:

  node example.js --config file://properties.json

good luck!
